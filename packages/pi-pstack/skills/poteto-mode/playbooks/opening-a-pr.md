### Opening a PR

Invoked at the end of every other playbook.

**Worktree.** Read `../references/branch-workflow.md`. Use the repository's branch and worktree tool. In a Lane-adopted repository, create an independent lane from the actual default branch. Give each writer its own branch and worktree. Pass the selected checkout explicitly to children. Do not reset another owner's worktree or share its branch. Preserve unrelated work.

**Commits.** Commit liberally. Rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit. New commit when separable.

**PRs.** Run `/skill:deslop` over the diff before commit. Run `/skill:no-comments` before review. Write every PR title, PR description, and commit body with `/skill:technical-writing`, then apply `/skill:unslop`. Apply every technical-writing layer except Diátaxis. Use one word for each action, keep articles, and avoid `-ing` when a plain verb works.

**Titles.** Use Conventional Commits in the form `type(scope): subject`. Use `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `perf` as the type. Use the changed area, such as `pstack` or `poteto-mode`, as the scope. Keep the subject short and imperative. Name a real symbol when one carries the change. For example, `fix(pstack): retarget opening-a-pr babysit trigger`. Do not add a trailing period.

**Descriptions.** The PR body is a briefing, not the lab notebook. A reviewer who has the diff should learn why the change exists, what is out of scope, and how you proved the change works. The squash commit body is the PR body. If the body would make the squash commit longer than about 40 lines, cut the body.

Use these sections in order. Drop a section when it has nothing to say.

- `## Why`. State the intent and approach in one or two short paragraphs. Do not list SHAs or rebase genealogy. Do not add a "based on main" preamble.
- `## Scope`. Use bullets to list real symbols and paths. Name both sides of a rename or retarget. State what is in and out only when the boundary matters. Do not write a file-by-file essay.
- `## Tradeoffs`. Name only rejected alternatives that a reviewer would otherwise ask about. Skip this section when there was no real choice.
- `## Blast Radius`. In one to three sentences, name who or what the change touches and why the change is safe or risky. State the continuing cost if main stays red without the fix.
- `## Verification`. Name each real run path and its outcome. For a performance change, report one primary number with its unit in `before → after` form. Link the arena or swarm directory for the remaining evidence. Do not include sample-size methodology, swarm recitals, or metric tables.

After these sections, attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Do not paste full SHAs, swarm or arena lane recitals, lever-correction essays, file-by-file checklists, or "CLEAN" verdicts. Put these details in a linked artifact. Do not use `## Summary` or `## Test plan` boilerplate. A commit body does not restate its subject.

**Forge.** Resolve the forge before the first PR operation and keep that choice for create, edit, view, watch, and merge. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the default. If `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, prefer `origin pr ...`. If Origin is absent or cannot resolve the repository, stay on `gh` and record the fallback. Do not require Graphite (`gt`).

**Size and dependencies.** Prefer narrow, independently reviewable PRs. Every PR targets the actual default branch. Run independent work in parallel. Start dependent work after its prerequisite merges. Keep tightly coupled work in one lane and one PR when it must be reviewed together. Do not construct a base-branch chain.

**Readiness.** Open every PR ready, never as a draft. With Origin, pass `--status open`. With `gh`, omit `--draft`. Cloud-agent PR tools default to draft, so set `draft: false` on every PR creation call. If a PR still opens as a draft, run `origin pr ready <number>` or `gh pr ready <number>` according to the resolved forge. Run `origin pr view <number>` or `gh pr view <number>` before you refer to PR status.

**Babysit.** Opening a PR does not start babysitting. Post the URL and continue the assigned build phase. Run a babysit pass when the user or owner brief assigns it. Review before landing does not require dependent PR branches. Push back when feedback drifts from intent.

A subagent that opens a PR first reads `../../code-review/SKILL.md` relative to this playbook's directory. It runs that coordinator in Challenge mode, `/skill:deslop`, and `/skill:no-comments`, and posts the URL. Then it returns to the parent without babysitting, unless it is an Autopilot-full or Autopilot-stack owner. That owner's brief assigns the babysit loop and is the ask `playbooks/babysit.md` waits for. The owner starts the loop after its code-ready report and reports MERGE-READY or REVIEW-READY as its playbook says. The review-only queue retains the operator's landing gate.
