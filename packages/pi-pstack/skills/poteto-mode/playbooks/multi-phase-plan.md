### Multi-phase or multi-PR plan

**You own the plan, not the code. The plan is a checklist an owner runs box by box and the operator audits from the evidence.** The plan is the deliverable. Do not implement.

1. When the change is one or two files with an obvious approach, skip the plan. Say so and stop.
2. Settle open questions by prototype before you write. Run `playbooks/prototype.md` for each. Keep the branch, the SHA, and the screenshots for Appendix A. Ask the operator only about a product or preference call that no run can settle. Give options (the **never-block-on-the-human** principle skill).
3. Explore in subagents with one `subagent({ action: "execute", input: { async: true, maxSubagentSpawnsPerRun: N, workflowScript } })` call and an explicit model per child from the Subagents section (the **guard-the-context-window** principle skill). In `workflowScript`, launch the explorers with `return await runs.all([{ key: "explore-<slice>", agent: "poteto-agent", task, model }])`. Each returns file pointers, conventions, test commands, and entry points. No inlined dumps.
4. Copy the skeleton below into the plan file and fill every placeholder. Read `../references/branch-workflow.md`. Select the shared absolute program directory once. Unless the operator names a path, write the plan under that directory's `docs/`. Keep every heading and every sub-block in the order shown. One section per PR. One PR is one change with its own evidence (the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill). Name the execution playbook in **How to read this**. Use Autopilot-full for authorized landing or the review-only queue in `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md` when the operator retains landing authority. Do not construct a dependent PR stack. A standing program takes `playbooks/orchestrate.md`.
5. Write under `/skill:technical-writing` in full, then `/skill:unslop`. The body is one Diátaxis mode, how-to. Appendices hold explanation and reference. Each heading states the task or the finding. No long dashes. No mid-sentence colons.
6. Run `node <installed-poteto-mode>/scripts/check-plan.mjs <plan.md>` and fix every line it prints (the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill).
7. Hand back. Post the plan path and the script's output, then stop. Execution starts on the operator's explicit go, under the execution playbook the plan names.

**Verification.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked (the **prove-it-works** principle skill). That sentence is the verification rule. Every verification block opens with it. The live block is mandatory. Ten lanes at the PR head drive the real surface through its control skill, per the **swarm** skill, on the `swarm workers` model (default inherit-parent). Each lane is one box with a concrete scenario, the screenshot it saves, and its pass predicate. One lane is the **Regression lane against trunk.** It runs the same load-bearing scenario on trunk and head. If trunk does not have the feature, the lane records that fact and gates the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for instead of inventing a trunk result. The perf gate is dual-sided. Trunk and head must both produce the named metric. If trunk lacks the feature, also isolate the work the diff adds and set an absolute budget for that work plus the end-to-end state the user waits for. Do not claim a ratio between unlike scenarios. The perf block names the metric, the interleaved probe, the trunk baseline measured first, and the rule with the number that fails. A PR that changes an interaction is review-gated. The operator reviews it in chat with screenshots and a video before merge. A PR that changes no interaction writes `**Review gate.** None. <PR id> is not review-gated.` and no boxes under it.

**Control skill.** Pick it by surface. Browser, Electron, and web UIs use the project's verification skill or harness. CLIs and TUIs use the project's verification skill or harness. Native mobile uses whatever simulator-driving skill the repo has. A PR that touches two surfaces gets lanes on both. A surface with no control skill is a risk in Appendix C, and its live block still names how each lane drives it.

# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a screenshot, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program reads `<installed-poteto-mode>/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md` from installed Pstack. <Who merges, and which PR ids are the operator's items that stop at merge-ready.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol and this plan to the operator, then stop. Start execution only on the operator's explicit go.
- [ ] On the operator's go, record a standing goal with this exact text. "<The plan path, the PR ids in order, the verification rule, who merges, and the done condition.>"
- [ ] Select one shared program directory under the primary checkout's `.pi/pstack/programs/<program-name>/`. Resolve it once to an absolute path and pass it to every owner.
- [ ] Discover the repository's actual default branch and record the trunk ref. Do not assume a branch or remote name.
- [ ] Read installed Pstack playbooks and skills at program start and every tick. Read project-specific guidance from the project repository.
  - [ ] `<installed-poteto-mode>/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`
  - [ ] `<installed-pstack>/skills/swarm/SKILL.md`
  - [ ] `git show <trunk-ref>:<control skill path>`
  - [ ] `<installed-poteto-mode>/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`
  - [ ] `<installed-pstack>/skills/<each other leaf skill the program uses>`
- [ ] Arm the 30-minute audit tick. Use one bounded `until` recurrence in the owning live Pi session. Use a durable scheduler when work must survive a crash or session replacement. Never leave the cadence to memory.
- [ ] Use this tick prompt, verbatim. "Re-read the installed execution playbook and the standing goal. Audit the operation against both and fix drift in this tick. Probe every active lane and judge progress by side effects only. Stand down a stuck writer. Confirm it cannot continue writing before transferring its branch. If stopping fails, keep write targets separate and report the blocker. Then post a short status message to the operator in chat only when the audit found a tracked change that no earlier status message reported, such as a PR opened, a code-ready head, a round launched or closed, a verdict, a merge, a stuck agent and the action taken, a blocker added or cleared, or a decision only the operator can make. Name every such change and nothing else. Do not repeat a table, the merged list, or an unchanged blocker. If the audit found none, end the turn with no reply text. Either way, log this tick's row in your decision trail. The row names the items reported, or none."
- [ ] On the operator's hold or stand-down, send every owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Spawn owners

- [ ] Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its prerequisite merges. Keep tightly coupled work in one lane and one PR.
  - [ ] <PR id> and <PR id> are independent and first. Both branch from the actual default branch.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change an interaction. They wait for the operator's review in chat with screenshots and a video before merge.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Resolve the forge once. Default to `gh`; if `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, use `origin pr` for every PR operation. Record any fallback to `gh`. Never require `gt`.
- [ ] Open the PR ready, never draft, with `origin pr create --status open --base <base-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <base-branch>` according to the resolved forge. Every PR targets the actual default branch.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run `/skill:deslop` before each commit and `/skill:no-comments` before review.
- [ ] Triage every Bugbot and security-reviewer comment per `../references/bugbot-triage.md`.
- [ ] Rebase onto current trunk before the code-ready report and babysit. Keep that merge base in fix rounds. Rebase again only at merge prep, on a `git merge-tree` conflict with trunk, or on a CI failure that comes from a change on trunk.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] At the code-ready head SHA and at each later push that changes the patch, run the swarm per `<installed-pstack>/skills/swarm/SKILL.md`. One gates lane. The ten live lanes from the PR's **Verify, live** block. The perf lane from its **Verify, perf** block. Two or more audit lanes, each with its own focus, that read the diff and the receipts and distrust the PR body. The root audits the receipts in the merge-ready report before the verdict.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner, including a defect that a lane filed as a note. A new head gets a fresh swarm and a fresh verdict, and verify the exact published head under `playbooks/shipping.md`.
- [ ] <The authorized merge or review-only handoff rule, with the exact-head guard from `playbooks/shipping.md`.>

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane runs at the PR head. Drive through the project's verification skill or harness.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Start the backend and the surface. Wait for ready.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the control skill's commands. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save every screenshot to `/tmp/swarm-<pr-id>/worker-<n>/<slug>.png` and return the paths with the report.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked. Ten lanes at the PR head, per the boot recipe.

- [ ] Lane 1. Regression lane against trunk. Run <the same load-bearing scenario> at trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, record that and gate <the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for>. Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 3. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 4. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 5. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 6. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 7. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 8. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 9. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 10. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured at both trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, also name the diff-added work and the end-to-end state the user waits for.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved. Both sides must produce the metric.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails. If the scenarios differ, add absolute budgets for the diff-added work and the user-visible end state instead of an invalid ratio.>

**Review gate.** The operator reviews before merge.

- [ ] Copy lane <n> screenshots into `<media path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>.png`.
- [ ] Record a 30 to 60 second video of the change on a lane VM. Save it as `<media path>/<pr-id>-review.mp4`.
- [ ] Post the screenshots and the video in chat. Stop at merge-ready. Wait for the operator's click.

**Merge.**

- [ ] Root's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] Bugbot triage done.
- [ ] The verdict describes the exact current published head. A rebase requires renewed verification.
- [ ] <The owner merges the independently verified PR when authorized, or the operator reviews and lands it.>
